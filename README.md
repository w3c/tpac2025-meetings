# TPAC 2025 meetings

This repo is for collecting requests to schedule group meetings during [TPAC 2025](https://www.w3.org/2025/11/TPAC/). We invite W3C group chairs and staff to use this repo. If you have any questions, please write to w3t-tpregister@w3.org.

* [List of meeting requests](https://github.com/w3c/tpac2025-meetings/issues)
* [Form to request a meeting](https://github.com/w3c/tpac2024-meetings/issues/new?assignees=&labels=session&projects=&template=session.yml)

Notes: 

* We are using GitHub this year instead of WBS to collect meeting requests.
* We will use a different repo for breakout session proposals during TPAC 2025.

## Identifying acceptable meeting times

For TPAC 2025, groups can choose from among these meeting times:

* Monday: 9:00 - 10:30, 11:00 - 12:30, 13:30 - 15:00, 15:30 - 16:45
* Tuesday: 9:45 - 11:00, 11:30 - 13:00, 14:00 - 16:00, 16:30 - 18:00
* Thursday: 9:00 - 10:30, 11:00 - 12:30, 13:30 - 15:00, 15:30 - 16:45
* Friday: 9:00 - 10:30, 11:00 - 12:30, 14:00 - 16:00, 16:30 - 18:00

In the [form to request a meeting](https://github.com/w3c/tpac2024-meetings/issues/new?assignees=&labels=session&projects=&template=session.yml)
please identify (1) the total number of slots you would like for your
group meetings, and (2) which of above the meeting times are **acceptable** for your
meetings.

To express **preferences**, please use the text input. Preferences can include (but are not limited to):

* Preferred slots. For example: "We prefer Monday and Tuesday all day, but can live with Tuesday and Thursday." Or "We would like to meet in the first two slots on all four days."
* Groups to avoid conflict with
* Groups to meet jointly with

The meeting planners will be adding and editing sessions in GitHub so
that our scheduling tools can consume session descriptions and
preferences.
